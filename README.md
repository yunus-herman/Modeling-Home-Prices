## Background

Ames, Iowa with a population of more than 65,000 is an attractive location to live, study, business from people around the globe. 
Four season city with charm of recreational activities and parks has stable economy, cultural environment, great medical health care, great quality schools from kindergarten to university and safe neighborhood to live. So Ames is amazing city to live in.  

## Dataset

Kaggle.com provide me a dataset, with 79 detail features and complete descriptions of each features. For example the lot frontage is linear feet of street connected to property, type of street access to property, Lot size in squarefeet, type of utility, howmany bathrooms in basement or above the ground, and overall quality base on overall material and finish quality with ranks 1 to 10. I have to select the features that I am going to use for modeling and usefull for problem solving.  

## Data Cleaning
First I check on empty values. Some features should have null values for example Basement condition, null values indicates no basement. In this case, I convert the data into ranks or scales. for example 0 for no basement, 1 for poor condition, 2 for fair condition until 5 for excelent condition.
